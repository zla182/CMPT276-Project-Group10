# CMPT276 Group Project

Create and improve a platform for the purchase and sale of educational materials specifically for SFU students.

# Description

The main purpose of our web application project is to create a platform for SFU students and their peers to buy and sell textbooks or other resources. the SFU bookstore mainly sells expensive, brand new books, with a limited selection of used books. And the methods used now are through different groups of posts, or private messages, which are very unsafe. Our program, which allows all Canadian students to purchase textbooks, is not widely known and is deficient in some areas, such as ratings and reviews of sellers.
